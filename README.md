# AntiScamBotTool

An installable Discord interactions tool that allows us to be able to more easily interact with accounts and ScamGuard.

Contains:

* `/lookup` - for looking up an user via a command in a DM
* User Application Interaction - for looking up the user while looking at their profile
* Message Application Interaction - for forwarding/reporting scammers easily
* Helper functions for managing the tool that can be installed for a guild.

The end goal is to make everything work easier for users.  

You can forward messages directly to ScamGuard reporting + look up accounts all within the Discord UI.
